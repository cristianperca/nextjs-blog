Server-side Rendering","body":"<p>We recommend using <strong>Static Generation</strong> (with and without data) whenever possible because your page can be built once and served by CDN, which makes it much faster than having a server render the page on every request.</p>\n<p>You can use Static Generation for many types of pages, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Marketing pages</li>\n<li>Blog posts</li>\n<li>E-commerce product listings</li>\n<li>Help and documentation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You should ask yourself: &quot;Can I pre-render this page <strong>ahead</strong> of a user&#39;s request?&quot; If the answer is yes, then you should choose Static Generation.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Static Generation is <strong>not</strong> a good idea if you cannot pre-render a page ahead of a user&#39;s request. Maybe your page shows frequently updated data, and the page content changes on every request.</p>\n<p>In that case, you can use <strong>Server-Side Rendering</strong>. It will be slower, but the pre-rendered page will always be up-to-date. Or you can skip pre-rendering and use client-side JavaScript to populate data.</p>\n"},{"slug":"third-post","date":"2021-04-23","title":"Third Post","body":"<p>This is my third post, written in Markdown.</p>\n"}]},"__N_SSG":true}
